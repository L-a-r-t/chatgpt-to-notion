          When I first created ChatGPT to Notion, I wasn't at all expecting it
          to become the success that it is today! I am incredibly grateful for
          having the opportunity to bring something useful to tens of thousands
          of people. However, as I kept going through with my studies, I've been
          lacking time to maintain the extension and develop alternatives for
          other LLMs as much as I wanted to. <br />
          <br />
          As a way to keep myself motivated to work on this project and to
          sustain myself through my studies, I have implemented a premium
          subscription that I've been wanting to get rid of ever since. Being
          fully aware of the fact that having a large platform is a rare
          occurence, I want to be as positive as possible. That's why I'm
          partnering up with the team at allcolibri to give ChatGPT to Notion
          the opportunity to also be a net positive for the environment. <br />
          <br />
          Eco-friendly mode is a compltetely optional feature that I've been
          working on implementing. When visiting a partner website, a portion of
          the revenue generated from your visit will be used to plant trees and
          to remunerate the extension's development. If this partnership proves
          to be successful,{" "}
          <b>
            I will be using this revenue stream to make the extension features
            free for everyone.
          </b>
          <br />
          <br />
          Thank you for your interest in ChatGPT to Notion,
          <br />
